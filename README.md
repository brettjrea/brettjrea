## Hi there 👋

### My name is Brett, and I love computers, the internet, and learning to program for them.

- 🎓 I am a graduate of Grand Canyon University with a Bachelor of Science in Software Development.
- 🌟 Pardon the lack of repositories as I refresh and revitalize my GitHub to a more professional, post-graduate standard.
- 🛠️ I’m focusing on highlighting key, core long-term projects that will be actively maintained.
- 📚 Currently working through my documentation to reduce redundancies and create a single source of truth for both personal and public knowledge.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on exciting and impactful projects.
